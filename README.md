# Digital Library Management System API (.NET Microservices)

## Business Context

### Overview

The Digital Library Management System is a modern microservices-based backend API solution designed to digitize and
streamline library operations for public and institutional libraries transitioning from manual record-keeping to digital
platforms.

### Business Problem

Traditional libraries face several operational challenges:

- Manual tracking of book availability and reservations leads to errors and inefficiency
- Limited visibility into borrowing patterns and inventory usage
- Poor user experience with no self-service capabilities for browsing or reserving books
- Difficulty managing overdue books and calculating late fees
- Time-consuming checkout and return processes at the library desk

### Solution

Our Digital Library Management System provides:

- **Self-service portal** for users to browse, search, and reserve books online
- **Automated reservation management** with 7-day pickup windows
- **Real-time availability tracking** to reduce operational overhead
- **Librarian tools** for efficient checkout and return processing
- **Borrowing history** for patrons to track their reading activity
- **Microservices architecture** for scalability and independent service deployment
- **Cloud-ready infrastructure** for AWS deployment

### Target Users

1. **Library Patrons**: Browse catalog, reserve books, view borrowing history
2. **Librarians**: Process checkouts and returns, manage reservations

## Architecture Overview

### Microservices Design

The system consists of **three independent microservices**:

1. **User Service** (Port 5001)
    - User registration and authentication
    - JWT token generation and validation
    - User profile management
    - User validation for other services

2. **Catalog Service** (Port 5002)
    - Book inventory management
    - Catalog browsing and search
    - Book availability tracking
    - Availability updates from reservations

3. **Reservation Service** (Port 5003)
    - Reservation lifecycle management
    - Checkout and return processing
    - Borrowing history
    - Orchestrates calls to User and Catalog services

### Service Communication

- Each service has its own database (Database per Service pattern)
- Services communicate via HTTP/REST APIs
- User Service provides authentication for all services
- Reservation Service orchestrates business workflows

## Getting Started

### Core Requirements Documents

**Review these foundational documents before implementation:**

1. **[User Stories](docs/user-stories.md)** - **START HERE**
    - 11 user stories defining all system functionality
    - Business requirements and acceptance criteria
    - Your primary requirements document

2. **[API Contracts](docs/api-contracts.md)** - **CRITICAL**
    - Complete external API interface specification
    - All 10 endpoint definitions with request/response formats
    - Defines the contract you must fulfill

3. **[Development Environment Setup](docs/dev-enviroment-setup.md)**
    - Initial project setup and local development configuration

### Implementation Approach

**Prioritize understanding requirements over implementation details:**

- User Stories define business requirements and desired outcomes
- API Contracts define the exact external interface
- Milestone documents provide technical guidance and acceptance criteria

You have flexibility in **HOW** you implement the solution, but must meet the requirements defined in User Stories and
API Contracts.

- `GET /api/catalog/books` - Browse and search books with pagination
- `GET /api/catalog/books/{bookId}` - View detailed book information

### Reservation Service (Port 5003) - 5 Endpoints

- `POST /api/reservations` - Reserve an available book
- `GET /api/reservations` - View active reservations
- `POST /api/reservations/{reservationId}/checkout` - Checkout book (Librarian only)
- `POST /api/reservations/{reservationId}/return` - Return book with late fee calculation (Librarian only)
- `GET /api/reservations/history` - View complete borrowing history

**See [API Contracts](docs/api-contracts.md) for complete specifications.**

## Development Philosophy

### Requirements-Driven Development

1. Understand the requirements (User Stories and API Contracts)
2. Design your microservices architecture (service boundaries, communication)
3. Plan your implementation (data models, inter-service contracts)
4. Build to meet the contract
5. Verify completeness (test against acceptance criteria)

### Implementation Flexibility

You decide:

- Internal code organization and architecture for each service
- Service layer design patterns
- Repository implementation approaches
- Validation strategies
- Testing frameworks
- Error handling mechanisms
- HTTP client implementation for inter-service calls

### Non-Negotiable Constraints

You must adhere to:

- User Story requirements and acceptance criteria
- API Contract specifications
- Microservices architecture (3 independent services)
- Business rules (reservation limits, dates, fees)
- Technology stack (ASP.NET Core, PostgreSQL, JWT)
- Security requirements (authentication, authorization)
- Database per Service pattern

Each service runs on a different port:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - User Service
cd UserService
dotnet run
# Runs on http://localhost:5001

# Terminal 2 - Catalog Service
cd CatalogService
dotnet run
# Runs on http://localhost:5002

# Terminal 3 - Reservation Service
cd ReservationService
dotnet run
# Runs on http://localhost:5003
```
